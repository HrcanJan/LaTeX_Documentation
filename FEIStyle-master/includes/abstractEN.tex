This bachelor thesis deals with the design and development of an interactive educational animation of an \acrshort{IGBT} transistor. The theoretical part consists of a brief analysis of interactive animations, available software and the principle of operation of \acrshort{IGBT} transistors. The technical part consists of a description of the solution, implementation part, evaluation of technical documentation, which will help to state and explain the technical details of the project. The result of the work is a functional interactive website and an application that describes an \acrshort{IGBT} transistor, consisting of six subpages and a main page. It is created using web technologies and provides all the bonuses that web technologies bring to the table. The benefit is that it is freely available to anyone interested. This work is significant, because the Insulated-Gate bipolar transistor animation is impossible to find on the Internet. This animation will be available on the educational portal eLearn central of the Institute of Electronics and Photonics, not only for students of bachelors study, but also for those interested in the issue.
